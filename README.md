# PROCJAM 2015's Island Sample Project

This is a sample Unity project showing simple island generation using 'cellular automata'. 

It uses Marsh Davies' 2015 PROCJAM Art Pack, which you can get for free at http://www.procjam.com/2015/09/procjam-art-pack-now-available/. The art is licensed under a Creative Commons BY-NC license, more info here: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/

Press R to regenerate islands, and the arrow keys to move around. The code isn't super well-documented so this is probably aimed slightly towards people who have worked in Unity before. Hopefully it's useful to someone starting off in procedural generation!

You can join in with the procedural generation jam, and watch talks by procedural generation experts, at our official sites online:
